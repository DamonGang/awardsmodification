Here is how to get my modification with prizes, in the rubenwardy awards mod src folder remove the awards (awards.lua) and get my modification which just adds prizes 
for everything (more fun) ... be sure to move the awards file from my version back into the main src folder where you deleted the old file ... all I did was 
add prizes and left the rest the same so most credit goes to Ruben Wardy and whoever else worked on this.
